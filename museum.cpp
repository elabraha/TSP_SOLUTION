/*
 Overview
 Welcome to the Mammoth Museum! This unique museum features mammoths frozen in ice,
 preserved perfectly to this very day! As a curator, you want to plan out the most efficient way to
 peruse every exhibit for your interested visitors.
 Your first task in part A is to plan the pathways connecting the different exhibits efficiently. (That
 is, minimize the total length of the pathways needed.)
 Then in parts B & C, you will plan an efficient daily route to check on each of the exhibits. (That
 is, minimize the distance you must travel to visit all the exhibits.)
 To be clear, these scenarios are separate, your program will create a plan for one or the
 other, but not both in the same run (although you may find that the algorithms from one mode
 help with another mode).
